This page details the process of converting `.wav` files into sample files compatible with *Ocarina of Time* and *Majora's Mask*.

## placeholder
One way of creating custom samples is by converting `.wav` files into `.bin` (or `.zsound`) files using the *vadpcm_enc* and *tabledesign* programs from the Nintendo 64 SDK, however those tools must be recompiled to work on x86 architecture as they were originally build for IRIX computers using the MIPS processor. Currently there is no active development for those tools, however there is a tool you can use with modern computers and processors called *z64audio*.

Unlike with N64 Soundlist Tool, obtaining all the data for the audiobank you will put the sample(s) in require different tools. The process of converting a `.wav` file is much more involved and can be quite tedious compared to N64 Soundlist Tool; however you can use samples from anywhere, not just other Nintendo 64 games.
