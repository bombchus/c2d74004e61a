!!! warning
    Custom sample injection is for creating non-vanilla sampled instruments, drums, or sound effects and assumes you already have a decent understanding of music creation and custom audiobanks, this is not a beginner's guide to music creation.

    Please only continue with this guide if you are comfortable using custom audiobanks and dealing with a great deal of trial and error.
