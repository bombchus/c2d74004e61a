This page goes over how to get started with SEQ64 for creating custom music in *Ocarina of Time* and *Majora's Mask*. It will give a basic rundown on the program as well as importing and converting a `.mid` file into a sequence file.

!!! info
    Please be aware that SEQ64 is an old program with many bugs, some known and others unknown. You may encounter errors and issues when using the program when editing a ROM, ROM description, sequence file, or audiobank file.
